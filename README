This is the first basic implementation of a Kinect interface in Blender.

Right now, you have to have Brandyn's python stuff installed - which requires
quite a few dependencies, I may be using an old version, but I'll get onto
looking at that later.

Loading it into Blender with the "Text File" internal thing right now, running
by pressing Alt+P - it does some weird thing where it only iterates through
4-6 times.  I'll have to figure out why it does that.



Credits:

I used Brandyn's python front-end for Kinect, and reference that in the source code.

Also, I used a little part of the PLY import by Bruce Merry, to get just
the vertices to show up, and no other parts of the mesh.
